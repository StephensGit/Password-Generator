# Password Generator

This is an application I developed that allows the user to create a random password using a generator tool encorporating Neumorphic design. 
I use lastpass [https://www.lastpass.com/features/password-generator] on a weekly basis for work, so I decided it would be fun to build a basic version of my own and also design it using Neumorphic design. While the application is rather basic, I was just curious about how to create neumorphic design using css.
